# squidguard-blocklist
Scripts and some other things


its basically good to run it once a week on /etc/cron.weekly as most of the sites wont change
Moreover the Script should be 100% silent, if its output something, then there must me something horribly gone wrong ;D



# howto install?
Copy this script into /etc/cron.weekly
It does not make sense, to run it more often, due the changes are not often
