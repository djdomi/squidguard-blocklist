# squidguard-blocklist
Scripts and some other things


its basically good to run it once a week on /etc/cron.weekly as most of the sites wont change
Moreover the Script should be 100% silent, if its output something, then there must me something horribly gone wrong ;D



# howto install?
Copy this script into /etc/cron.weekly
It does not make sense, to run it more often, due the changes are not often


#What does it?
it catches from serval sources the hosts file formatted files and convert it into domain names only
this can be used either by 

## SquidGuard

or
## Squid ACL
